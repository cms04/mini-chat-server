# Mini-Chat-Server

A simple real-time chat server and client.

**IMPORTANT: This application is under construction! Especially it doesn't provide any kind of encryption yet! Use at your own risk!**

## Usage

Compile the program using the Makefile. Just type `make`. Then you can start the program with

`./minichatserver [-s] [-b <RSA KEY BIT LENGTH>] -u <USERNAME> -a <SERVER-ADRESS> -p <SERVER-PORT>`

Parameters:

- `-u`: Set the username that is shown in the chat to your chat-partner.
- `-a`: If you are the server, then you have to specify your IP-Adress with this parameter. If you are the client, you specify the IP of your chat-partner with this parameter.
- `-p`: If you are the server, then you have to specify the server-port with this parameter. If you are the client, you specify the server's port on your chat-partner's computer with this parameter.

Optional parameters:

- `-s`: Activates the server mode. If you are the server, set this parameter, otherwise don't set it.
- `-b`: Sets the RSA key bit length, default is 2048. You can choose 1024, 2048, 4096 or 8192. A higher number means more security, but your computer needs more time for encryption, decryption and key generation. 1024 is very fast but not recommended for security reasons!
